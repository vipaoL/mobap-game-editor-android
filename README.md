# **It's not a game itself! It's just an editor for it. The game is here: https://github.com/vipaoL/mobap-game**

Default working directory is /sdcard/MGStructs/ . Game running on j2me loader can find this directory automatically (there are some problems on android 11+, but you can use old version of j2me loader which uses legacy storage permission)
